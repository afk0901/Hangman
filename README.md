# Hangman: Unravel the Mystery Word

Dive into a classic game of Hangman, where suspense meets strategy. 
Presented with a series of underscores representing an unknown word fetched from an external API, 
your mission is to unveil the hidden word letter by letter. 
But beware, each incorrect guess brings you closer to the looming gallows. 
As the game unfolds, you'll be continuously prompted for your next guess, and the 
incorrectly guessed letters will be displayed, guiding (or taunting!) you on your journey 
to solve the mystery. Will you decipher the word in time, or will the hangman claim another victim? The challenge awaits!
